# VVM Digital I/O Raspberry Pi Hat

This hat provides power to the Raspberry Pi through a generic MP1584 DC/DC converter, the bus connector with supplies and I2C, and an optional WS2812.

The Raspberry Pi hat schematic and layout is based on [Xesscorp's RPi Hat Template](https://github.com/xesscorp/RPi_Hat_Template).
